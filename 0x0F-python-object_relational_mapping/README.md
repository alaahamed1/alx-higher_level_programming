Description for all the files and directories in this directory Any file that does't have a description -if there any- is for testing purposes

`0-select_states.py`  -> a script that lists all states from the database  `hbtn_0e_0_usa`:

The script takes 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name (no argument validation) The script connects to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306 Results is sorted in ascending order by states.id

`1-filter_states.py`  -> a script that lists all states with a name starting with N (upper N) from the database  `hbtn_0e_0_usa`:

The script takes 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name (no argument validation) The script connects to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306 Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id

`2-my_filter_states.py`  -> a script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the states table of  `hbtn_0e_0_usa`  where name matches the argument.

The script should take 4 arguments: mysql username, mysql password, database name and state name searched (no argument validation) The script connects to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306 Results will be sorted in ascending order by states.id

`3-my_safe_filter_states.py`  -> the same as  `2-my_filter_states.py`  but safe from MySQL injections!

`4-cities_by_state.py`  -> a script that lists all cities from the database  `hbtn_0e_4_usa`

The script takes 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name The script connects to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306 Results is sorted in ascending order by cities.id

`5-filter_cities.py`  -> a script that takes in the name of a state as an argument and lists all cities of that state, using the database  `hbtn_0e_4_usa`

The script takes 4 arguments: mysql username, mysql password, database name and state name (SQL injection free!) The script connects to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306 Results must be sorted in ascending order by cities.id

`model_state.py`  -> a python file that contains the class definition of a  `State`  and an instance  `Base = declarative_base()`: State class: inherits from  `Base`  links to the MySQL table  `states`  class attribute  `id`  that represents a column of an auto-generated, unique integer, can’t be null and is a primary key class attribute  `name`  that represents a column of a string with maximum 128 characters and can’t be null The script connects to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306 WARNING: all classes who inherit from Base must be imported before calling  `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)`

`7-model_state_fetch_all.py`  -> a script that lists  `all State`  objects from the database  `hbtn_0e_6_usa`

Your script should take 3 arguments:  `mysql username`,  `mysql password`  and  `database name`  The script connects to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306 Results will be sorted in ascending order by  `states.id`

`8-model_state_fetch_first.py`  -> a script that prints the first State object from the database  `hbtn_0e_6_usa`

`9-model_state_filter_a.py`  -> a script that lists all State objects that contain the letter a from the database  `hbtn_0e_6_usa`

`10-model_state_my_get.py`  -> a script that prints the State object with the name passed as argument from the database  `hbtn_0e_6_usa`

`11-model_state_insert.py`-> a script that adds the State object “Louisiana” to the database  `hbtn_0e_6_usa`

`12-model_state_update_id_2.py`  -> a script that changes the name of a State object from the database  `hbtn_0e_6_usa`  Change the name of the State where id = 2 to  `New Mexico`

`13-model_state_delete_a.py`  -> a script that deletes all State objects with a name containing the letter a from the database  `hbtn_0e_6_usa`

`model_city.py`  -> similar to  `model_state.py`  contains the class definition of a City. City class: inherits from Base (imported from model_state) links to the MySQL table cities class attribute id that represents a column of an auto-generated, unique integer, can’t be null and is a primary key class attribute name that represents a column of a string of 128 characters and can’t be null class attribute state_id that represents a column of an integer, can’t be null and is a foreign key to states.id

`14-model_city_fetch_by_state.py`-> prints all City objects from the database hbtn_0e_14_usa
